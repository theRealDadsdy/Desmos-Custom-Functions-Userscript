# Desmos-Userscript
A Desmos Userscript allowing for the creation of custom functions, and soon strings
## Unsolved Issues
Feel free to give suggestions
### Custom Functions
1. Allow non-action functions with custom outputs
### String
1. Implement them, like, at all
## Completed Issues
1. Make the functions auto-update, so you don't have to update them yourself. (Done by theRealDadsdy)
2. Allow multiple functions to accept the same named parameter. (Done by theRealDadsdy)
3. Allow lists as inputs. (Done by theRealDadsdy)
